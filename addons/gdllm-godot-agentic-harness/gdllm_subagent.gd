class_name GDLLMSubagent extends Node
## A fresh-context helper the chat spins up to offload a self-contained task to its own model instance, then hand only the result back to the main agent — the narrow-context idea one level down: the subagent sees the task it's given, never the main conversation. It runs headless (no UI): handed a task it either answers in one shot (tool-less — the shape read_file uses to map a long file) or, when given tools, runs its own agentic tool loop (tool_search → read_file/search_files/…, exactly like the main chat) until it has an answer. Add it to the tree, `await run(...)`, use the returned text, then free it; `cancel()` interrupts it (and any nested subagent) for the Stop button.

signal request_finished(outcome: Dictionary) ## Internal: resolves one _send()'s await exactly once with {kind: "text"|"tools"|"error"|"cancelled", ...}; guarded by _done so a late signal (or a cancel racing a completion) can't double-fire.
signal activity(event: Dictionary) ## Emitted for each step the subagent takes — its reasoning, intermediate notes, tool calls, tool results, and per-request usage stats, plus (forwarded) those of any nested subagent — so the chat can surface the whole inner run rather than hiding it behind a spinner. Each event carries a `depth` for indentation. Live `phase` events (reasoning started, answer started) additionally steer the panel's bottom status row mid-request. Display only: never fed back to any model.

var was_cancelled: bool = false ## True once cancel() interrupted this run (or a nested one), so the caller can abort its turn instead of using the empty result. Also read inside the loop to bail between steps.
var mutation_ledger: PackedStringArray = PackedStringArray() ## The tool layer's own record of this run's successful mutating calls ("<tool> <target>" lines, a nested run's entries merged in), appended to a tools-enabled answer so the parent can diff engine truth against whatever the subagent claims it did.
var _client: LLMClient ## Private client owned by this subagent and freed with it, so its request can't collide with the main session's.
var _nested: GDLLMSubagent = null ## A subagent this one is itself running (a long-file map or a nested delegation); tracked so cancel() propagates down the chain.
var _done: bool = false ## Whether the in-flight request's await has already been resolved, so a completion arriving after a cancel (or vice versa) is ignored.
var _depth: int = 1 ## This subagent's nesting level, stamped on the activity events it emits so the chat can indent nested runs inside their parent's (set in run()).
var _turn_thinking: String = "" ## Reasoning accumulated for the in-flight request via thinking_delta, emitted as a `thinking` activity event once the turn resolves, then reset by the next _send().
var _allow_changes: bool = false ## The spawning session's "Make changes" state at launch, inherited so a subagent can never mutate more than the chat that spawned it.
var _allow_delete: bool = false ## The spawning session's "Delete files" state at launch, inherited the same way so a subagent can never delete more than the chat that spawned it.
var _ledger: GDLLMTools.SessionLedger = null ## The spawning session's tool ledger, shared so this run's reads and verdicts land in that session's record; null lets execute() fall back to its shared default (bare headless runs).
var _qualified_source: String = "" ## The run's source and model as a qualified id, stamped on stats events so each footer names who answered (set in run()).
var _reported_base: int = 0 ## The compaction predictor's base: the newest provider-reported prompt+output token count in the tool loop, 0 until a request reports usage (the trigger stays silent without one, like the main chat's).
var _delta_from: int = 0 ## Messages index the predictor's chars-per-token delta counts from — everything at or past it postdates the reported base.
var _compact_refusal_noted: bool = false ## A prune skip or refusal has been disclosed this run, so later rounds don't re-post the same unchanged reason (see _note_compaction_refusal).
var _over_window_noted: bool = false ## The over-window warning has been disclosed for the current overflow; re-armed once a prediction lands back under the window, mirroring the main chat's once-per-overflow rule.
var _repeat_scope: String = "" ## This run's own GDLLMRepeats owner id, set in run() — repeat numbering is per-agent like the loop brakes, so a fresh run's first call is never tagged as a repeat the main chat (or another run) made.


## The source a deferred `subagent` spec runs on: the caller's own `fallback` normally, or the settings' Tasks Model when the spec sets `tasks_model` — a pure transform like read_file's file map is a background chore fit for the small tasks model, unlike a delegation, which stays on the chat model. An unconfigured tasks model falls back to the caller's source so a flagged spec still runs.
static func spec_source(spec: Dictionary, fallback: Dictionary) -> Dictionary:
	if not bool(spec.get("tasks_model", false)) or GDLLMSettings.get_tasks_model() == "":
		return fallback
	var source := GDLLMSettings.get_tasks_source_and_model()
	if String(source.get("model", "")) == "" or String(source.get("base_url", "")) == "":
		return fallback
	return source


## One ledger line for an executed tool call — "<tool> <path>" plus " (left BROKEN)" when the result says the file was left broken — or "" for a call that only read, errored, or was refused, so the ledger holds exactly what the tool layer actually changed. The target is resolved through the same argument synonyms GDLLMTools reads, falling back to the bare tool name.
static func ledger_entry(tool_name: String, args: Dictionary, result_content: String) -> String:
	if not GDLLMTools.is_mutating(tool_name) or result_content.begins_with("Error"):
		return ""
	var entry := tool_name
	for key in GDLLMTools.FILE_PATH_KEYS:
		if args.has(key) and String(args[key]).strip_edges() != "":
			entry += " " + String(args[key]).strip_edges()
			break
	if result_content.contains("BROKEN on disk"):
		entry += " (left BROKEN)"
	return entry


## Run `prompt` on the resolved `source` (endpoint + key + wire format + model, from GDLLMSources.resolve_qualified) under `system_prompt` and return the model's answer. With `use_tools` false it's a single tool-less turn (a pure transform, e.g. mapping a file). With `use_tools` true it runs an agentic loop — the model reaches the project's tools through tool_search just as the main chat does — until it produces a final answer or is cancelled; the loop has no iteration cap, but it carries the main chat's loop brakes (see GDLLMLoopBrakes) and its setting-gated context compaction (tool-result pruning; see _maybe_compact), and a tripped escalation ends the run with the model's own progress summary as its answer (see _break_loop) — the top-level Stop (cancel) remains the manual brake. `depth` is this subagent's nesting level (1 for one the main chat spawned), stamped on its activity events so the chat can indent nested runs. `allow_changes` is the spawning session's "Make changes" state, gating mutating tools exactly as it does in the main chat, and `allow_delete` its "Delete files" state, gating destructive ones the same way. `ledger` is the spawning session's tool ledger, shared down the whole subagent chain. A request failure resolves to an "Error: …" string the caller can surface; a cancel resolves to "" with was_cancelled set.

## A loop guard tripped mid-run: name the interruption in the activity feed (the red counterpart of the main chat's redirect notice), then re-send the conversation with the reflection `instruction` and NO tools, so the model must answer in prose — the same stop-and-account redirect the main chat performs. That summary becomes the run's answer, prefixed with the stop and its `reason` so the parent agent knows the run was interrupted rather than finished.

## The main chat's compaction trigger and over-window guard, one level down (see GDLLMChatSession._maybe_trigger_compaction / _maybe_warn_over_window): before each tool-loop request, predict its size — the newest reported usage plus a chars-per-token estimate of everything appended since — and once prediction + buffer reaches the model's window, prune old tool-result outputs from the loop's messages. No summarization runs down here: a subagent's growth IS tool results, exactly what pruning reclaims. The inner transcript is working state the activity feed has already surfaced in full, so the prune edits it in place, and every commit, refusal, and still-over-window outcome is disclosed as an activity event that persists with the panel (goal 2). The PASS is gated exactly like the main chat's — silent while the window is unknown, until a request has reported usage, and when compaction is switched off — but the window GUARD is not held back with it (also like the main chat): a prediction past the window still warns with no reported base (flagged as an estimate) or with compaction off, on the same asymmetry — a false warning self-corrects on the next report while a silent truncation is neither, and a run on a provider that reports no usage would otherwise go unwatched for its whole length.

## The subagent counterpart of the main chat's over-window warning (see GDLLMChatSession._maybe_warn_over_window): the coming request is predicted past the model's window and no available pass got it back under, so the provider would reject it or silently truncate its oldest part — disclosed as a red activity note, the run's only honest move left. Fires once per overflow (_over_window_noted), re-arming as soon as a prediction lands back under. `estimate_only` marks a prediction with no reported base behind it, named as an estimate rather than quoted like a measurement.

## The tail of the over-window warning, resolved from why the guard fired: an estimate with no reported base behind it, compaction switched off (the lever to pull), or a genuine overflow the pruning pass couldn't clear. Static and settings-free so the message ladder is testable headless, mirroring GDLLMChatSession._over_window_advice.
static func _over_window_advice(estimate_only: bool, compaction_on: bool) -> String:

	return " even after compaction — the provider may reject it or silently truncate its oldest part."


## Pruning inside the loop's messages, under the same user settings and eligibility as the main chat's pass (see GDLLMChatSession._prune_tool_results); the swap writes the messages array directly, since the loop's transcript is working state rather than stored history — the activity feed above keeps every full output. A skip or refusal is disclosed once per run rather than re-posted on every continuation. Returns the tokens reclaimed.

## The loop-message indices a prune would clear, oldest first, plus the tokens clearing them reclaims, as {indices, saved} — the same eligibility the main chat's pass applies: guarded tools, errored results, already-pruned entries, the newest PRUNE_KEEP_RECENT_PAIRS pairs, and results not longer than the stamp are all exempt. Static and settings-free so the policy is testable headless.

## Disclose a prune skip or refusal as an orange activity note, once per run — the trigger re-evaluates before every continuation, and re-posting an unchanged reason each round would drown the feed; a committed prune re-arms it, since the next refusal would be new information.
func _note_compaction_refusal(text: String) -> void:
	if _compact_refusal_noted:

## The tools attached to a subagent's request: always tool_search, plus every tool it has activated by searching — the same narrow-context footprint AND gate filter the main chat uses (see GDLLMChatSession._tools_for_active_set): a gated tool's schema is dead weight on a request whose every call to it would be refused.
func _build_tools(active_tools: Dictionary) -> Array:
	var tools: Array = [GDLLMTools.tool_search_schema(_allow_changes, _allow_delete, active_tools)]

## Append the run's tool-layer record to a tools-enabled final answer — engine truth the parent can diff against the subagent's own claims of what it changed, which transcripts show can be pure invention. Cancelled and errored returns pass through untouched, and tool-less transform runs never reach here.

## Collapse a terminal request outcome into the run's return string: the reply text (a cut-short one carrying its truncation note), any preamble text that rode alongside tool calls, an "Error: …" line, or "" when cancelled.
func _final_text(outcome: Dictionary) -> String:

		_:
			return ""


## The disclosure appended to a reply the provider or transport cut short (see LLMClient's `truncated` stat), so a partial answer — or a transform run's half-finished file map — is never handed to the parent as whole; unlike the display-only stamp the main chat uses, this rides the result itself, because the result IS what the parent model consumes.
static func _truncation_note(outcome: Dictionary) -> String:
	var stats: Dictionary = outcome.get("stats", {})
	if not bool(stats.get("truncated", false)):
		return ""
	var stop := String(stats.get("stop_reason", ""))

	return "\n\n[Note: the connection dropped before this reply finished — treat it as incomplete.]"


## A failed run's report to the parent model: the cause plus the decision it now faces — a cause alone leaves the parent knowing what broke but not whether to retry, take over, or surface it.
static func _failure_text(reason: String) -> String:
	return "Error: the subagent could not complete its task: %s [Next step: retry the subagent once if the cause reads as transient (timeout, dropped connection); otherwise do the task yourself with your own tools, or tell the user what is blocking it.]" % reason

func _on_generating_started() -> void:

## Emit `event` as this subagent's activity, stamped with its nesting depth so the chat can indent it. A nested subagent's events arrive already stamped and are forwarded unchanged (see _forward_activity).
func _emit(event: Dictionary) -> void:
	event["depth"] = _depth
	activity.emit(event)


## Emit the reasoning accumulated for the just-finished request as a `thinking` event, if any, so nothing the subagent reasoned through stays hidden.
func _emit_thinking() -> void:
	if _turn_thinking.strip_edges() != "":
		_emit({"type": "thinking", "text": _turn_thinking})


## Surface one request's usage as a `stats` activity event — the subagent counterpart of the main chat's per-message footer, carrying the client's estimates and any provider-reported counts alike. Skipped only when neither kind of count exists: a model-only footer on every inner turn would be clutter, not data.
func _emit_stats(outcome: Dictionary) -> void:

	_emit({"type": "stats", "stats": stats, "seconds": float(outcome.get("seconds", 0.0)), "model": _qualified_source})


## Re-emit a nested subagent's activity as our own so it bubbles up to the chat; the event keeps its own deeper depth for indentation.
func _forward_activity(event: Dictionary) -> void:
