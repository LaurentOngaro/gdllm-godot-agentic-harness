## Per-project persistence and in-memory roster of chat sessions. Everything lives in a single JSON file under user://gdllm/, which Godot resolves to a per-project, per-machine folder — so no manual project keying is needed.
## Disk writes are debounced: mutations arrive in bursts (several per agentic turn), and rewriting the whole growing file per mutation stalls the editor. save() marks the roster dirty and one timer flushes the burst; structural changes (create/delete) and the dock's exit path flush immediately, so the only loss window is GDLLMTunables.SESSION_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS of tail on a hard editor crash.

## Emitted when a session's title changes (e.g. after Tasks-Model summarization). The dock's session dropdown and tab listen to this to refresh their labels.
signal session_title_changed(id: String, title: String)

## Emitted when persistence itself fails or a broken roster is set aside: the dock surfaces the message in the editor, because a push_warning alone leaves a save outage visible only to users with the Output panel open (goal 2).
signal store_failed(message: String)

## Read the roster from disk. A missing file leaves an empty roster (a fresh start); a corrupt one is moved aside to a timestamped backup before the empty roster loads, so a later flush() can't overwrite the bytes a recovery would need. An existing file that can't even be OPENED may still be a valid roster (permissions, a transient lock), so it is left in place and saving is disabled instead — flushing over sessions that were never loaded would destroy them.

## Write the roster to disk now, absorbing any scheduled debounce-write. Compact JSON — the file is a per-machine cache rewritten whole on every flush, and the in-editor "Inspect model context" view pretty-prints its own reconstruction, so an indent here would only pay write cost.

## The record for `id`, or an empty Dictionary if none. The returned Dictionary is the live record (mutating it mutates the roster).
func get_session(id: String) -> Dictionary:

## Drop the reasoning blocks a provider echo stored beside a tool-call turn (see ECHO_THINKING_TYPES; summary and encrypted content alike — see LLMClient.last_assistant_blocks), so "Clear Thinking" removes reasoning from disk and from any resend, not just from the display fields.

## Remember a session's reasoning-effort selection ("" = Default) and persist. No-op when absent or unchanged. Every record carries the key — seeded from the model's remembered level at creation, stamped Default by _normalize for older files — so the stored value is always the session's authoritative choice.
func set_effort(id: String, effort: String) -> void:

## Backfill any missing fields on a record read from disk so older or partial files load cleanly. `legacy_make_changes` is the file's retired project-wide flag, seeding records that predate the per-session field.
