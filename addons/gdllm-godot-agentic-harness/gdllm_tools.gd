class_name GDLLMTools extends RefCounted
## Registry of chat tools, exposed to the model through the narrow-context "tool_search" pattern: only `tool_search` is ever attached to a request up front, keeping the prompt's tool footprint to a single entry. That entry always carries the catalog of registered tool names and descriptions (see _catalog), so the model can see what exists; searching a name returns that tool's full parameters (and the session attaches it to later turns), so the model pays for the verbose part of a tool's schema only once it actually wants to use it. Every method is static — this is a namespace, not an instance.

const TOOL_SEARCH := "tool_search"

# How many idle user turns retire an attached tool's schema at a cache-bust boundary (see GDLLMChatSession._cross_cache_boundary; one tool_search re-attaches it) is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/context section.

## Appended to tool_search's description only once this session has actually retired something: the model needs the detachment rule only when it's real, and the note first appears in the request whose tools block the retirement already rewrote, so it never costs a cache invalidation or tokens of its own before then.
const TOOL_SEARCH_RETIREMENT_NOTE := "Note: attached tools left idle for several turns are detached again to keep requests small — if a tool you had is no longer marked attached, search its name again to re-attach it."

## What a model sees in place of a pruned tool result's output; the user-facing record (stored history, activity feed) always keeps the full output. Shared by the main chat's pass and the subagent loop's (see GDLLMChatSession._prune_tool_results and GDLLMSubagent._prune_loop_results). It names the remedy rather than only the loss: the call that produced it is still right beside it in the history, arguments intact, so re-running it is a step the model can actually take.
const PRUNED_RESULT_STAMP := "[Old tool result pruned, re-run tool if output is needed again]"

## The tool a user attachment is carried as: the user's Script and Selection toggles append the read_file call that would have produced the attached text, plus its result (see GDLLMChatSession._append_attachment_pair). A real registered tool rather than an invented name, so the pruned stamp's "re-run tool" is an action the model can actually take, the schema rides along like any other used tool, and nothing downstream needs an attachment-specific branch. Must stay a REGISTRY key.
const READ_FILE := "read_file"

## The tool a scene-tree selection attachment claims ran, named here so the session builds its call without spelling the registry key (see format_attachment_scene).
const DESCRIBE_SCENE := "describe_scene"

## Tools whose results the pruning passes never touch; tool_search stays out because schema retirement already reclaims idle tool_search attachments on its own cache-boundary schedule.
const PRUNE_GUARDED_TOOLS: Array[String] = ["tool_search"]

# How many newest tool call/result pairs the pruning passes always leave intact — the model's working set for the turn in flight — is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/compaction section.

A .tscn scene likewise returns its saved node tree rather than the serialized text, at a fraction of the cost — describe_scene_file with node_path then zooms into one node's saved properties, connections, and groups. Set `full` to true to override either and get the entire file verbatim even when it is long — for the rare case you genuinely need every line rather than a map; expect it to consume much more of your context. Long packed-array data blobs in a .tres/.tscn (PackedByteArray image data, PackedVector3Array mesh vertices, and so on) are elided to markers like \"<N bytes elided>\" in every DEFAULT read, since raw serialized numbers carry no readable information; `full: true` is the one route to them — it returns the file verbatim, payloads included, which is what a wholesale rewrite of such a file needs (expect elided payloads to be large).

Errors that surface in OTHER files while the project loads (a broken autoload, another plugin) are not blamed on the checked file. Two things differ for a shader: the compiler stops at the FIRST error, so a clean result after a fix is the only proof there was just one, and an error inside an #include'd file is reported naming that file and its line, since that is where the fix goes.

A run the USER started is never touched: if a game is already playing, the call refuses rather than hijacking it. The game runs the project as saved on disk; the editor's save-before-running setting decides whether unsaved editors are saved first, and the result notes when that setting is off while unsaved scenes exist. The capture also carries a one-line performance digest (FPS, frame time, draw calls, memory, nodes) from the game's monitor stream, and `profile` true additionally runs the engine's function profiler for the window and reports the hottest functions (read_performance and profile_game do both against an already-running game).

That is what makes it the tool for anything that happens too fast to watch: freeze, look at the state, advance one frame, look again — a moving-target bug becomes a series of still frames. This is NOT the debugger's break (debug_game): nothing is stopped at a line of code, there is no call stack, and the game resumes with no execution state disturbed — it is the pause between frames, not inside them. It is also not the game's OWN pause (SceneTree.paused, which read_game_ui reports as PAUSED): a pause menu still processes nodes set to run while paused, where this stops everything.

(2) THIS PROJECT'S OWN class_name scripts come from the loaded script's registered API — use this instead of reading a whole script file when you want a project class's shape: it gives every method signature, exported and plain variable with its type, signal, constant, and inner class, plus the chain up through any base scripts to the engine base, and it names the file so read_function or read_file can fetch a body you actually need. (3) The Variant types (Array, Dictionary, Callable, Vector2, …), the built-in scopes (@GDScript, @GlobalScope), and @GlobalScope's global enums by their bare name (Key, Error, MouseButton) come from the engine's own documentation cache, which is the only registry that holds them — ClassDB does not.

The result is narrowed on two independent axes, and using them is what makes this cheaper than reading or grepping the source: `kind` selects one part of the API (\"signals\", \"methods\", \"properties\", \"enums\", \"constants\", plus \"constructors\"/\"operators\" on a Variant type and \"inner_classes\" on a project script), and `filter` selects members whose NAME contains a substring. A question about one kind should always pass it — \"what signals does the player emit\" is kind=signals, and on a large class that is a few hundred bytes instead of the whole API. They combine (e.g. class \"Control\", kind \"properties\", filter \"focus\"). When you already know one member's name and just need its exact shape, use describe_member instead.

These are the settings the editor's Import dock shows: they belong to the ASSET, not to any scene or resource that uses it, and they are the only place things like a texture's compression mode, mipmap generation, or SVG scale can be set. Pass `path` as the asset itself (\"res://sprites/hero.png\"), not its .import sidecar, and `settings` as an object of setting names to values, e.g. {\"compress/mode\": 0, \"mipmaps/generate\": true} — the names are exactly those in the asset's .import file, which read_file shows with \"full\": true. Each value is coerced to the type that setting already holds, so a whole number lands in a float setting as a float. Settings that are a CHOICE from a fixed list — a texture's compress/mode, its detect_3d/compress_to, roughness/mode, a WAV's compress/mode — are stored as bare numbers whose meaning nothing in the file records, so pass the NAME instead and let it be resolved: {\"compress/mode\": \"Lossless\"} is safer than guessing that lossless is 0 (it is 0; 3 is VRAM Uncompressed). A number outside that setting's list is refused with every legal value and its number named, and the result reports each value with its name so a wrong choice is visible rather than echoed back as the figure you sent. A setting name the importer does not declare is REFUSED with the real names listed and nothing written, because the engine silently DROPS an unrecognized setting on the next import rather than reporting it — a typo would otherwise report success having changed nothing. After the re-import the .import is read back and the result states which settings actually took, so a value the importer declined is never reported as set. Omit `settings` entirely to just RE-IMPORT the asset as it stands: that is the fix when an import failed and you have corrected the cause, when the source file was replaced outside the editor, or when an asset was written by another tool and has never been imported at all.

The resource is loaded through the editor's own cache, so an inspector already showing it reflects the edit.

Every name is first checked against the resource's real editor-visible property list — an unknown one aborts the whole call with near-miss suggestions and writes nothing — so a batch either applies in full or not at all. Each value is coerced to the property's declared type: a JSON number or boolean sets a numeric or bool property (int vs float per the declared type); a JSON string sets a String/StringName property directly, is parsed as a Godot literal for a typed value (e.g. \"Vector2(64, 32)\", \"Color(1, 0, 0, 1)\"), or is taken as the res:// path of a resource to load for a property that holds another Resource; a JSON array becomes a Godot array (packed where the property demands).

You must have SEEN the file's real text first: a file you have not read this session — via read_file, read_function, or search_files excerpts (a long-file map or a search overview shows shape, not text, and does not count) — is refused until you do. The match must be EXACT — every character, including indentation (a .gd here is tab-indented), trailing spaces, and line breaks — so copy the text to replace straight from a read_file or read_function result rather than retyping it (search_files excerpts carry \"  12: \" line-number prefixes that are NOT part of the file). By default `old_string` must match exactly ONE place: if it matches nothing exactly, a whitespace-tolerant fallback compares whole lines — a UNIQUE spot differing from your text only in whitespace is edited anyway, with new_string's indentation adjusted to the file's and the result disclosing exactly what landed — and failing that you are told it wasn't found, with the actual cause named when detectable (an old_string copied from a version of the file your own write already replaced is called out as stale). If it matches several places you get the count and are asked to add surrounding lines until it's unique — or set `replace_all` true to change every occurrence at once (useful for renaming a symbol). Keep `old_string` as small as it can be while still unique; you do not resend the whole file. When the edited file is a GDScript (.gd), the change is validated after writing by launching the engine headlessly: a parse/compile check and this addon's own style lint, each compared against the file's pre-edit state so only problems your edit introduced are reported. The edit is KEPT either way: one that introduces parse/compile errors leaves the file BROKEN on disk and the errors come back with their line numbers — fixing them immediately, with further edit_file calls against the text you just wrote, is then your top priority before any other work. New style-lint problems also keep the edit and come back as follow-ups to clean up. A .gdshader is validated the same way by the engine's own shading-language compiler (no style lint — that guide is GDScript's), so a broken shader is reported here rather than surfacing only when the user runs the game; note the shader compiler stops at the FIRST error, so re-check after fixing one. A .tscn or .tres is validated the same way by a headless load check, and an edit that stops the file loading is likewise kept, reported, and yours to fix at once; a .tscn that still loads is additionally checked for stored properties and node types the engine doesn't know — those load silently and are DROPPED when the scene is instantiated, so any this edit introduced come back as a warning to fix. Serialized scene/resource text must be copied verbatim from read_file (on a .tscn that means \"full\" set to true or a line range — the default saved-tree view is not text), never reconstructed from a describe_scene or describe_scene_file view. To change a PROPERTY of a .tres/.res — including one the file does not list yet, such as a shader uniform just added — prefer edit_resource, which sets it by name against the resource's real type instead of by hand-editing serialized text. A clean open scene has its tab reloaded after the edit so the editor shows the new state; a scene open with unsaved live edits is left alone, and the editor's own external-change handling resolves the conflict. The result is compact: a confirmation and a short excerpt of the changed region with a line of context on each side, never the whole file. After a successful edit the editor's filesystem is refreshed and, if the file is open in the script editor, it is reloaded there in place — unless the user has unsaved changes in it, in which case Godot prompts them to resolve the conflict as usual. Binary files are refused; the project's user:// data files are editable too, disclosed as unvalidated where the engine's checks can't ground a verdict. Never write a uid:// value you invented: UIDs are engine-assigned, an invented one can never resolve, and an edit introducing one into a project (res://) file is refused — reference dependencies by res:// path, or use the real uid a tool result reported (a write_file/create_resource confirmation, list_dependencies, or a read of the target). The uid machinery is a project-tree service: an edit landing on a user:// or outside file keeps its text exactly as sent, unvetted.

Use it for a genuinely new file — a new script, a config, documentation — or to REPLACE an existing file wholesale: a file already at `path` is overwritten with `content`, so only ever send a COMPLETE file, never a fragment. To change part of an existing file use edit_file instead, which edits by exact replacement and keeps the rest intact. Two safety refusals return without touching disk: overwriting an existing file you have NOT read this session is refused (read it first to confirm you mean it, since the write replaces the whole file — and a file whose read came back with \"<... elided>\" packed-array markers stays refused even after reading, because a rewrite built from that view would destroy the real data behind the markers; change such a file with edit_file, or re-read it with read_file full:true, which returns the payloads verbatim and re-grounds the wholesale write), and creating a NEW file whose name already belongs to a file elsewhere in the project is refused (you most likely meant that existing file) — set `force` true to override either once you are sure. For a new saved resource prefer create_resource, which validates properties against the resource's real type rather than writing raw text. When the written file is a GDScript (.gd) or a .gdshader it is validated afterward by launching the engine headlessly, exactly like edit_file — the engine's parser for a script, its shading-language compiler for a shader: the file is KEPT either way, and content with parse/compile errors leaves it BROKEN on disk with the errors returned line-numbered — the file then holds exactly what you sent, and fixing those errors with edit_file calls (no need to resend everything) is your top priority before any other work. Style-lint problems likewise keep the file and come back in the result as follow-ups (scripts only — the style guide is GDScript's). The editor's filesystem is refreshed afterward so the new file appears immediately. The project's user:// data directory is writable too (without the project-tree uid and validation services), and the path must carry the file's extension. A new .gd, .gdshader or .gdshaderinc is assigned its uid and .uid sidecar on creation (those three carry their uid in a sidecar rather than in the file), and the confirmation for any of them, or for a .tscn/.tres, reports the file's real uid — the one to use in preloads. That whole uid machinery is a project-tree service: a user:// or outside destination gets no uid and no vetting, its content lands exactly as sent, and the confirmation names no uid to preload by. Never write a uid:// value you invented: UIDs are engine-assigned, an invented one can never resolve, and content introducing one into a res:// destination is refused — reference dependencies by res:// path, or use the real uid a tool result reported.

Identity only exists to the editor's project scan, so a copy landing on user:// or (fence dropped) outside keeps the source's bytes verbatim — uid text included, disclosed as inert in the result.

## Mandatory follow-ups bound to events — the generic registry behind automatic actions, so a new one is a declaration here rather than another one-off mechanism. Each entry names the `event` it fires on ("tool_completed", emitted by execute after every tool call, is the only event so far), the `tools` it applies to ("*" binds it to every tool — the registry's keys aren't reachable from a const expression), and the `action` id _run_hook_action dispatches on (an id rather than a Callable — a const can't hold one). An action returns the text to surface or "" to stay silent; a report is appended to the tool result, so the model and the user both see it (goal 2) and a silent hook costs the context nothing (goal 1). Because execute is shared, hooks fire for the main agent and subagents alike.
const EVENT_HOOKS := [
	{"event": "tool_completed", "tools": ["read_file"], "action": "check_script"},
	{"event": "tool_completed", "tools": ["edit_file", "write_file"], "action": "check_dependents"},
	{"event": "tool_completed", "tools": ["*"], "action": "broken_reminder"},
]

# Most dependent files the automatic cross-file check names before summarizing the rest (see _check_dependents_hook) is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section — so a hub-class rename doesn't flood the context.

## Fallback reflection instruction for a tool that trips its loop guard without declaring its own `loop_break_message`. Both `%s` are the tool's name (see loop_break_message).
const DEFAULT_LOOP_BREAK_MESSAGE := "You've called %s several times in a row without making progress, so the tool loop has been stopped for you. Do not call %s again. In a few sentences addressed to the user, summarize what you were trying to accomplish and what you suspect went wrong. Be concise and honest about the uncertainty."

## Reflection instruction when a run keeps re-running identical calls past the duplicate stubs and repeat notes — the escalation behind GDLLMTunables.WITHHELD_ESCALATION_THRESHOLD; `%d` is the repeat count. Same no-tools redirect flow as a streak guard trip, but asks for a progress account, since the repeats say the model has lost track of where it is.
const DUPLICATE_ESCALATION_MESSAGE := "You have re-run identical tool calls (same tool, same arguments, same unchanged result) %d times this turn, so the tool loop has been stopped for you. Do not repeat any earlier call. In a few sentences addressed to the user, summarize what you have completed so far, what remains, and where you are stuck. Be concise and honest about the uncertainty. If a well-defined chunk of the task remains, you may tell the user you can hand it to a fresh-context helper via the run_subagent tool."

## Stand-in for a tool result whose identical call (same tool, same arguments) already ran this run and returned this same content — a repeat that provably added nothing, so the body is withheld rather than re-served (see GDLLMLoopBrakes.process_result; a mutating tool's repeat instead serves in full behind a repeat note there, since its re-run hit disk again). Gentler than the streak guard: the loop continues, but the repetition is named.
const DUPLICATE_CALL_NUDGE := "Result withheld: this exact call (same tool, same arguments) already ran earlier this turn and returned this exact result — re-read it at the earlier call; re-serving it here would only repeat what this conversation already carries. Repeating the call cannot help — change the arguments or the approach, or stop and tell the user what you're stuck on."

## The closing sentence a tool appends to a failure that a later call genuinely can clear — a condition outside the model's control that resolves on its own, not a mistake in the call.
## It exists as a shared constant because the duplicate brake reads it: a withheld repeat of an invited retry must not answer with DUPLICATE_CALL_NUDGE's "repeating cannot help", which would pit two harness messages against each other (the transcript-measured dead end that motivated EDIT_RETRY_SERVE_NOTE) — so an invitation is a contract with the brake, never hand-written prose.
const TRANSIENT_RETRY_INVITATION := "This is a transient condition, so trying the call again in a moment is worthwhile."

## Stand-in for a repeat of a call whose earlier result carried TRANSIENT_RETRY_INVITATION: the retry was the invited move, so the repetition is not the model's error — but the identical body proves the condition has not cleared, so the answer names that and hands back the two moves that remain instead of re-serving it.
const TRANSIENT_REPEAT_NUDGE := "Result withheld: this exact call already ran earlier this turn and returned this same transient failure, so the condition it named has not cleared yet and the earlier result still stands. Retrying was the right move, but retrying again this turn will not clear it — carry on without what this call would have given you, and tell the user it is unavailable so they can check it themselves."

# search_files' defaults and caps — context lines around a match (an explicit context_lines ask itself is uncapped — see _search_files), excerpt blocks per result, whole-function excerpt length, the overview threshold, function names per overview line, and file-name suggestions on an empty result (the universal suggestion cap) — are user-configurable, kept small by default so a single result stays a narrow-context excerpt rather than a file dump; see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section.
## Where installed addons live. A whole-project search sets matches under here aside (counted and disclosed, see _addon_scope_note) because vendored addon code is not the project's own — and this is a boundary about relevance, not about THIS addon: the uid lint's narrow `res://addons/gdllm-godot-agentic-harness/` skip answers a different question (what a match MEANS), and singling out our own directory would leave the other half of the noise in place.
const ADDONS_ROOT := "res://addons/"

## The one-line usage reminder search_files errors carry, so a malformed call (misnamed key, missing query) comes back with the exact expected shape instead of a dead end.
const SEARCH_USAGE := "Put the text to find in \"query\" ({\"query\": \"...\"}) — matched as a literal, case-insensitive substring — plus an optional \"path\" scoping to a file or directory."

# The character count past which read_file stops returning a file whole and has a fresh-context subagent map it instead (overview + function signatures — see _read_file), and the payload count past which a packed-array literal is elided to a count marker (serialized blobs run to kilobytes of base64 on one line, noise no model can interpret — see _elide_packed_arrays; elision runs first, so a blob-heavy but otherwise-short file is read whole rather than pointlessly mapped), are both user-configurable with 0 (or -1) disabling each — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section. Characters, not lines, because context cost is characters: wild-measured, 43% of all whole-file read bytes came from files under the old 1000-line gate but ≥12 KB.

## The packed-array constructors read_file elides, mapped to how many printed numbers make up one element (a Vector3 prints as three), so the marker can report true element counts. PackedStringArray is deliberately absent — its payload is readable text, not a data blob.
const ELIDABLE_PACKED_ARRAYS := {

## System prompt for the subagent read_file spins up on a long file: it maps the file for an agent that hasn't seen it — an overview plus every declaration's signature — rather than echoing the code, so the main agent learns the file's shape cheaply and can pull specific code afterward (see _summarize_via_subagent).
const READ_FILE_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_PROMPT := "You are a code-analysis subagent embedded in the Godot editor. You are handed the full text of one source file. Produce a concise map of it for another agent that has NOT seen the file:\n\n1. A short overview (2-4 sentences) of the file's purpose and responsibilities.\n2. Every top-level declaration in source order. For a class or node, give its name and what it extends. For each function, give its full signature — name, parameters (with types when present), and return type — followed by a one-line description of what it does; mark it static when it is. List member variables and constants only briefly, and only when they matter to understanding the file.\n\nDo not reproduce function bodies or paste large code excerpts. Be terse and factual. Output Markdown. The reader can request the actual code of specific functions afterward if they need it."

## System prompt for a subagent the model spins up through the run_subagent tool: a fresh-context helper handed one self-contained task and the context the main agent chose to pass. It can't see the conversation, but it runs its own agentic tool loop (reaching the project's tools through tool_search, just like the main chat), so it can gather what it still needs and hand back only the result — keeping the main agent's working context narrow (see _run_subagent_tool and GDLLMSubagent).
const RUN_SUBAGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT := "You are a subagent spun up by an AI assistant working inside the Godot editor to handle one self-contained task with a fresh context. You cannot see the main conversation and you cannot ask follow-up questions — but you DO have the project's tools: call tool_search to discover and then use them (reading files, searching the project, and so on) to gather anything you need beyond the task and context you were handed. Work the task through to completion, then return only the result that was asked for: no preamble, no restating of the task, and no commentary about being a subagent or offers to help further. If you genuinely cannot complete the task, say briefly and specifically what stopped you. Use Markdown when it makes the result clearer."

## Longest a delegated subagent's progress-caption label runs before it's truncated with an ellipsis, so a wordy task instruction doesn't sprawl across the caption (see _subagent_task_label).
const SUBAGENT_LABEL_MAX_CHARS := 60

## The one-line usage reminder use_skill errors carry, so a malformed call comes back with the exact expected shape.
const USE_SKILL_USAGE := "Put the skill's name in \"name\" ({\"name\": \"...\"}), exactly as the skills list in your system prompt gives it."

## Argument-name synonyms each tool accepts (see _arg_string), so a model that guesses a natural key — the catalog shows tool names, so it sometimes calls a tool without first fetching its real schema — still resolves instead of being silently ignored. The first entry is the canonical name the tool's schema advertises.

## edit_file argument aliases (see _edit_file), tolerant of a schema-blind call the way the other tools' key lists are; the first entry of each is the canonical name the schema advertises.

const EDIT_REPLACE_ALL_KEYS := ["replace_all", "all", "global", "every", "all_occurrences"]
## String.similarity floor under which a fully missed old_string gets no closest-region quote — a dissimilar line would only mislead (see _edit_file_closest_region).
const EDIT_CLOSEST_REGION_FLOOR := 0.6
## edit_resource's property-map argument, tried in order like the other synonym lists so a schema-blind model's natural key still resolves.
const EDIT_RES_PROPERTY_KEYS := ["properties", "props", "values", "vars", "variables", "changes", "fields"]
const CLASS_KEYS := ["class", "class_name", "name", "type"]
## describe_class's `kind` argument, narrowing the report to whole SECTIONS where `filter` narrows it to names — the two axes a question actually comes in. Wild-measured on the real 1666-line Player: "what signals does it emit" costs 9.3 KB as a whole-class report and 1.6 KB as its Signals section, against 14.7 KB for the search_files chain the model reaches for instead, which is the difference between the tool marginally winning and decisively winning.
## Keyed by the canonical name, valued with the section title it selects, so a rung simply matches its own section titles against the requested set.
const CLASS_KINDS := {
	"properties": "Properties",

## Spellings folded onto a canonical kind, so a model writing what it means ("functions", "vars", "signal") is not refused over a plural.

}
const CLASS_KIND_KEYS := ["kind", "kinds", "member_kind", "section", "sections", "only"]
## "query" is deliberately NOT a filter alias: session logs show a schema-blind model passes the class it wants under "query", so it falls back to the class side (see _class_arg) — as a filter it silently matched nothing.
const MEMBER_FILTER_KEYS := ["filter", "member", "contains", "search"]
const INHERITED_KEYS := ["inherited", "include_inherited", "with_inherited", "all", "ancestors"]
## describe_member's key lists omit "name" from the class side — a bare "name" argument almost always means the member.
const MEMBER_CLASS_KEYS := ["class", "class_name", "type", "target"]
const MEMBER_NAME_KEYS := ["member", "name", "method", "property", "signal", "function", "func", "constant", "enum"]
## describe_docs' member keys omit "name" — with an optional member, a bare "name" almost always means the class/page.
const DOCS_MEMBER_KEYS := ["member", "method", "property", "signal", "function", "func", "constant", "enum", "annotation"]
## The project-settings tools' argument synonyms; the filter side takes "query" too, since a schema-blind model browsing settings reaches for it.
const PROJECT_SETTING_KEYS := ["setting", "name", "key", "property", "option"]
const PROJECT_FILTER_KEYS := ["filter", "section", "prefix", "contains", "search", "query"]
const SET_SETTING_VALUE_KEYS := ["value", "to", "new_value", "val"]

const SET_SETTING_CREATE_KEYS := ["create", "force", "new"]
## set_import_setting's batch argument; the singular spellings are here because a model changing one setting reaches for them before it reaches for the plural.
const IMPORT_SETTINGS_KEYS := ["settings", "setting", "params", "options", "values"]
## list_directory's opt-in for the sidecar files it otherwise folds away.
const LIST_SIDECAR_KEYS := ["sidecars", "show_sidecars", "include_sidecars", "all"]
# list_directory's row cap is user-configurable (see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section; the largest legitimate directory measured in a real project ran 163 rows, and the wild overflow was res://.godot/imported at ~700 cache entries per call), and the opt-out below waives it ("all" belongs to the sidecar list above, so it is not an alias here).
const LIST_FULL_KEYS := ["full", "full_list", "no_cap", "complete", "everything"]
## The console tools' argument synonyms: read_output's line tail, read_errors' entry limit, and the substring filter both share, tolerant of schema-blind calls like the other lists.
const CONSOLE_LINES_KEYS := ["lines", "count", "limit", "tail", "last", "n"]
const CONSOLE_LIMIT_KEYS := ["limit", "count", "errors", "tail", "last", "n", "max"]
const CONSOLE_FILTER_KEYS := ["filter", "contains", "search", "grep", "match", "query", "text"]
## The run tools' argument synonyms, tolerant of schema-blind calls like the other lists; run_script's path side adds "script", the key a model naturally reaches for there.
const RUN_SCENE_KEYS := ["scene", "path", "file", "scene_path", "filename", "target"]
const RUN_WAIT_KEYS := ["wait_seconds", "wait", "seconds", "duration", "time"]

const RUN_TIMEOUT_KEYS := ["timeout_seconds", "timeout", "max_seconds", "limit"]
const RUN_SCRIPT_PATH_KEYS := ["path", "script", "file", "filename", "filepath"]

## One-line usage reminders the run tools' argument errors carry, in the SEARCH_USAGE pattern.
const RUN_GAME_USAGE := "All arguments are optional: \"scene\" plays one scene (res:// path) instead of the main scene, \"wait_seconds\" sets the capture window (default {tunable:run_game_default_wait_seconds}, max {tunable:run_game_max_wait_seconds}), \"keep_running\": true leaves the game up for the user afterwards, and \"show\": [\"collisions\"] draws debug overlays in the run."
const RUN_SCRIPT_USAGE := "Pass the script in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://checks/my_check.gd\"}) — it must extend SceneTree and end with quit(); optionally \"args\" (an array of strings the script reads via OS.get_cmdline_user_args()) and \"timeout_seconds\" (default {tunable:run_script_default_timeout_seconds}, max {tunable:run_script_max_timeout_seconds})."

## The tools that execute project code — game runs, headless scripts, the game-driving tools that feed input into or call methods on a live run, and stepping a paused one back into motion. They ride the `mutating` gate (executed code can change anything the edit tools can), and _dispatch words their refusal as running code rather than modifying files.
const RUN_TOOLS := ["run_game", "stop_game", "run_script", "send_game_input", "call_game_method", "debug_game", "suspend_game", "reload_game_scripts"]

## The tools that change WHERE the project's code stops rather than running any of it. They ride the same `mutating` gate — a breakpoint halts the user's run at a line they did not choose, and that halt blocks every other game tool — with their own refusal wording, since claiming set_breakpoint runs or modifies anything would be a lie the model repeats to the user.
const DEBUG_TOOLS := ["set_breakpoint"]

## Tools whose IDENTICAL call does the work again rather than returning a stale answer: stepping a frame, arming or clearing a breakpoint, replaying an input, pushing a reload, resuming a paused game, running a script, re-importing an asset (a no-settings set_import_setting call is a rebuild), re-taking the user's focus to a place they navigated away from. Their results are numbered from the second occurrence on (see GDLLMRepeats), because the duplicate brake reads identical content as a repeat that added nothing and four such firings end the turn — measured, on four of these tools. Membership is the whole opt-in: a new tool that does real work on repeat joins this list and needs no numbering code of its own.
const REPEAT_REAL_WORK_TOOLS := ["suspend_game", "set_breakpoint", "send_game_input", "reload_game_scripts", "debug_game", "run_script", "set_import_setting", "open_for_user"]

# run_game's capture-window bounds (default covering boot plus first frames, cap keeping one call from parking the tool loop for minutes) are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.
# How long after launch the editor may report no playing scene before run_game calls the launch failed (rather than mistaking slow boot for an instant crash) is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.
# run_script's timeout bounds (the model may raise the default up to the cap, since a legitimate script can compute longer than a load check) and its output-line relay cap (more generous than the console default because a killed or finished subprocess's output has nowhere else to live — what it drops, only a re-run can reprint) are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime and gdllm/tool_output sections.

## The game-driving tools' argument synonyms and usage lines, in the same tolerant-key pattern; the step dictionaries inside send_game_input's array have their own tolerant keys in GDLLMGameProtocol.

const CALL_GAME_METHOD_USAGE := "Pass the live node in \"path\" and the method in \"method\" ({\"path\": \"/root/Main/Player\", \"method\": \"take_damage\", \"args\": [10]}); \"args\" is optional."
const GAME_FILTER_KEYS := ["filter", "contains", "search", "match", "query", "name"]

const INSPECT_GAME_NODE_USAGE := "Pass the live node in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"/root/Main/Player\"}); \"filter\" optionally narrows to properties whose name contains it, and \"all\": true adds the engine's own properties."
## suspend_game's argument synonyms and the spellings of each action, in the tolerant-key pattern the rest of the tools use; "pause"/"freeze" land here rather than on debug_game, whose own aliases deliberately leave them out.
const SUSPEND_ACTION_KEYS := ["action", "state", "op", "command", "do", "mode"]

# The most frames one suspend_game call may advance (stepping stays a bounded look rather than an unattended run) and the whole call's wall-clock stepping budget (a game too slow to confirm its frames reports how many it managed rather than parking the tool loop) are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.
# The frame-landed poll interval and the wait for a stepped frame's prints to cross the debugger (a suspended game answers slowly, and the whole point of stepping one frame is to see what it printed) are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.

## reload_game_scripts' argument synonyms and usage; the cap on how many changed scripts one reload pushes before the list is refused as too broad to be a targeted fix is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.

## The editor's Debug-menu run flags, as the project-metadata keys the engine reads at launch (EditorSettings project metadata, section "debug_options"), keyed by the name run_game's `show` takes. Both hot-reload flags are set for every run this session starts: the reload message needs BOTH armed at launch or it silently breaks the running scripts instead of updating them (probe-verified on 4.7).

const DEBUG_GAME_USAGE := "Pass \"action\" as one of \"break\" (halt a running game), \"continue\", \"step\" (into), \"next\" (over), or \"out\" ({\"action\": \"next\", \"times\": 3}); \"times\" repeats a step up to {tunable:debug_game_max_steps} times."

# How long one step press may take to land the next break, the shorter window a resume is watched for an immediate second break, and the frames the script editor gets to build the breakpoint gutter are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.

## The performance tools' argument synonyms and usage lines, in the same tolerant-key pattern; run_game's profile flag rides its own list, and doubles as a profiler selector there.
const PERF_SECONDS_KEYS := ["seconds", "window", "duration", "last", "time"]

const PROFILE_GAME_USAGE := "All arguments are optional: \"seconds\" sets how long the profiler samples the live game (default {tunable:profile_game_default_seconds}, max {tunable:profile_game_max_seconds}), \"mode\" picks which profiler — \"functions\" (default), \"visual\", or \"network\" — and \"limit\"/\"filter\" control the report rows (raise the row cap, or match rows by name)."
const READ_VIDEO_RAM_USAGE := "Both arguments are optional: \"limit\" sets how many of the largest resources to list (default {tunable:video_ram_default_rows}, max {tunable:video_ram_max_rows}) and \"filter\" keeps only rows whose path, type, or format contains it (e.g. \"res://textures\")."
# profile_game's sampling-window bounds are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section.
# The Video RAM refresh reply wait and the clicked-control record settle are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_runtime section. The game drains click records at about one per second (probe-measured: adjacent clicks' records arrive almost exactly 1000 ms apart), so the last click's record trails the sequence's reply by up to a second; the settle default covers the dominant one-or-two-click case, and the composer's wording owns the cadence for longer chains rather than claiming a miss for a record still queued.
## list_dependencies' argument synonyms; the reverse side accepts the natural "who uses this" spellings.
const DEPS_PATH_KEYS := ["path", "file", "filename", "filepath", "resource", "target"]
const DEPS_REVERSE_KEYS := ["reverse", "users", "usages", "referenced_by", "reverse_deps", "who_uses", "uses"]

## One-line usage reminders for the docs-search, dependency, and project-settings tools, in the SEARCH_USAGE pattern.
const SEARCH_DOCS_USAGE := "Put two or three concept words in \"query\" ({\"query\": \"text wrap\"}) — every word must appear in a single doc entry's name or prose."
const LIST_DEPENDENCIES_USAGE := "Pass the file in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://icon.svg\"}); add \"reverse\": true to list what USES the file instead of what it depends on."
const DESCRIBE_PROJECT_USAGE := "All arguments are optional: \"setting\" reads one exact setting (e.g. \"input/jump\"), \"filter\" lists every setting whose name contains it (e.g. \"display/window\"), and neither gives the project overview."
const SET_PROJECT_SETTING_USAGE := "Pass \"setting\" (e.g. \"input/jump\", \"autoload/GameState\", \"application/run/main_scene\") and \"value\" (for an input action, event strings like \"Space\" or \"JoyButton:0\"); \"revert\": true restores the default or removes a custom entry."
const SET_IMPORT_SETTING_USAGE := "Pass the ASSET in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://sprites/hero.png\"}) and optionally \"settings\" as an object ({\"compress/mode\": 0}); with no settings the asset is simply re-imported."
## The extensions whose files carry engine dependency records; everything else is text for the purposes of dependency tracing.
const DEP_RESOURCE_EXTENSIONS := ["tscn", "scn", "tres", "res"]
# The most dependency/user lines one list_dependencies result prints before collapsing the rest (in the narrow-context spirit) is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section.

## The one-line usage reminder create_resource errors carry, so a malformed call comes back with the expected shape instead of a dead end.
const CREATE_RESOURCE_USAGE :="Pass \"from\" (a .tres/.res path, a built-in Resource class like \"StandardMaterial3D\", or a script class/res:// .gd path) and \"path\" (the res:// destination ending in .tres or .res); optionally \"properties\" (name→value) and \"overwrite\" (true to replace an existing file)."
## describe_scene's selector keys include "path"/"file" — a model passing a path to this tool means an open scene's file; the node-path keys deliberately omit "path", which on describe_scene_file must keep meaning the scene file.
const SCENE_SELECT_KEYS := ["scene", "path", "scene_path", "file", "filename", "root"]
const NODE_PATH_KEYS := ["node_path", "node", "nodepath", "node_name", "target"]

const DESCRIBE_TILESET_USAGE := "Pass the TileSet in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://tiles.tres\"}, or a .tscn to describe the TileSet its layers use), plus optional \"kind\" (sources/terrains/custom_data), \"filter\" (name substring), and \"layer\" (which layer's TileSet, for a scene using several)."
const EDIT_TILEMAP_USAGE := "Pass \"scene\" (the .tscn), \"layer\" (name or path), and exactly ONE action: \"cells\" ([{at, source, atlas?, alt?}]), \"fill\" ({rect, source, atlas?}), \"replace\" ({from, to, rect?}), \"erase\" ({cells|rect|source}), or \"terrain\" ({cells|rect, terrain}). Sources and terrains go by name or id."

## Animation tool argument aliases and usage reminders, in the same tolerant-key pattern as the tilemap tools.
const ANIMATION_NAME_KEYS := ["animation", "anim", "animation_name", "clip"]
const ANIMATION_PLAYER_KEYS := ["player", "animation_player", "node"]
const ANIMATION_WINDOW_KEYS := ["window", "time_window", "range"]
const DESCRIBE_ANIMATION_USAGE := "Omit arguments for the currently edited scene, or pass \"scene\" ({\"scene\": \"res://x.tscn\"} — a scene file, or an Animation/AnimationLibrary .tres); optional \"animation\" zooms into one animation's tracks and keys, \"player\" picks one AnimationPlayer, and \"window\" ([start_sec, end_sec]) narrows the key listing."
const EDIT_ANIMATION_USAGE := "Pass \"scene\" (the .tscn or .tres), \"animation\" (its name — describe_animation lists them), and exactly ONE action: \"add_track\", \"remove_track\", \"move_track\", \"insert_key\", \"set_key\", or \"remove_key\" — or \"add_animation\"/\"remove_animation\", which name their library instead of \"animation\"."

## One-line usage reminders the scene inspection tools' argument errors carry, like SEARCH_USAGE, so a malformed call comes back with the expected shape instead of a dead end.
const DESCRIBE_SCENE_USAGE := "All arguments are optional: \"scene\" picks an open scene by its res:// path, file name, or root node name; \"node_path\" zooms into one node (e.g. \"Player/Sprite2D\", \".\" for the root); \"depth\" limits the tree depth; \"filter\" (with node_path) narrows the node's properties and connections by name, values printed whole."
const DESCRIBE_SCENE_FILE_USAGE := "Pass the scene file in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://x.tscn\"}), plus an optional \"node_path\" to zoom into one node (e.g. \"Player/Sprite2D\"), \"depth\" to limit the tree depth, and \"filter\" (with node_path) to narrow the node's properties and connections by name, values printed whole."

## The editor-awareness tools' argument synonyms and usage lines, in the same tolerant-key pattern as the other lists.
const UNDO_WINDOW_KEYS := ["window", "count", "limit", "last", "n", "actions"]

const OPEN_FOR_USER_USAGE := "Pass the file in \"path\" ({\"path\": \"res://player/player.gd\"}); optionally \"line\" (1-based) opens a script at that line, and \"reveal\": true selects the file in the FileSystem dock instead of opening it."
# read_undo_history's window bounds (the default covers a working stretch of edits, and the cap keeps a history of user actions from ever dumping whole) are user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section.

## edit_file's one-line usage reminder, like SEARCH_USAGE, and the lines of context shown on each side of the changed region in the result excerpt so a confirmation stays a narrow snippet, not a file dump.
const EDIT_FILE_USAGE := "Pass \"path\" plus \"old_string\" (the exact text to replace) and \"new_string\" (its replacement); add \"replace_all\": true to change every occurrence instead of requiring a unique match."

# The most located errors a validation report shows with an excerpt (so a badly broken file doesn't flood the result) is user-configurable — see GDLLMTunables' gdllm/tool_output section.

## write_file argument aliases and usage reminder, in the same tolerant-key pattern as the other tools.
const WRITE_CONTENT_KEYS := ["content", "text", "contents", "body", "source", "data"]
const WRITE_FILE_USAGE := "Pass \"path\" (the res:// destination, with extension) and \"content\" (the COMPLETE text the file will hold — an existing file is replaced wholesale)."
## write_file's force flag: waives the blind-overwrite read gate and the phantom-duplicate collision refusal, nothing else. Deliberately NOT "overwrite" — a model passes that key spontaneously on any intentional replacement, which would waive the read gate on exactly the hallucinated-content calls it exists to catch; force/confirm are only ever sent in answer to a refusal.
const WRITE_FORCE_KEYS := ["force", "confirm"]

A tool in `active_tools` is marked "attached" so the model doesn't re-search tools it already holds (a transcript-observed habit). While `allow_changes` is off, mutating tools are omitted rather than listed as disabled — dead weight in the context — and one closing line says so, so the model asks the user rather than concluding the capability doesn't exist; destructive tools get the same treatment under `allow_delete`, each gate named by its own toggle.

static func max_consecutive_uses(name: String) -> int:
	return int(_definition_for(name).get("max_consecutive_uses", -1))


## The one-off reflection instruction injected when a tool trips its loop guard, asking the model to explain itself before the stop notice shows (the session sends it as a user turn with no tools attached and never stores it). A tool may declare its own tailored `loop_break_message` otherwise DEFAULT_LOOP_BREAK_MESSAGE is used, naming the tool.

## Nudge appended to a round's last tool result when the run's rounds ping-pong A→B→A→B between two tools AND some call in the cycle re-returned an already-seen result — a cycle the single-tool streak guard can't see, named only once the repeat proves it isn't converging (see GDLLMLoopBrakes.oscillation_nudge).

static func _schema(name: String, entry: Dictionary) -> Dictionary:
	# Tool prose quotes its own defaults and caps as {tunable:...} tokens; fill() substitutes the values currently configured, so the model is never told a number the settings no longer hold.

## Registered tools matching `query`, most-relevant first, each as {name, description, parameters}. A query word that exactly names a tool returns just the named tool(s) — the model picked from the catalog, so nothing else should ride along. Otherwise a tool matches only when EVERY query word appears in its name or one-line summary; any looser rule returned most of the registry for vague queries, so matches are strict, with ties broken toward name matches. The GDLLMTunables.TOOL_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS activation cap is applied — and disclosed — by _tool_search, not here, so a silent cut never masquerades as the whole match set. Mutating tools are excluded while `allow_changes` is off — and destructive ones while `allow_delete` is off — matching the catalog, so a search can never activate a tool the session would refuse to run.

## The tools `query` would have matched with the session's gates open, as {name, remedy} entries, empty when both gates are already on. The catalog tells the model that hidden tools exist, so a search naming one must say which toggle hides it — the generic no-match text contradicts the catalog, and transcripts show a model concluding from it that the capability does not exist at all and telling the user so.
static func _gate_blocked_matches(query: String, allow_changes: bool, allow_delete: bool) -> Array:

## A tool_search call's {content, activate}: every match comes back as a slim {name, summary?, note} entry, never its full schema — activation already attaches the schema to the next request's tools array, so serializing it into the result too would duplicate it in permanent history on every later request (the old first-time behavior this replaces, forward-only so stored results stay byte-identical for prompt caches). Each note includes the tool's call shape — transcripts show weak models re-search precisely when they've lost the calling syntax, and ignore a bare "do not search again" — and a fresh match adds its catalog summary so the model can pick among several. A search that only re-finds attached tools skips the JSON block entirely, and one that matched nothing only because a gate hid the tool names it and the toggle instead (see _gate_blocked_matches). Entries keep the {"tools": [{"name": …}]} shape active_tools_from_history parses to restore activations on reload. `activate` still names every match; re-activating an attached tool is a no-op.

## Run a tool call and return {"content": String, "activate": PackedStringArray}: `content` is the result fed back to the model as the tool message, and `activate` names the tools the session should attach to later turns (a search activates everything it returned; other tools activate nothing). A tool may instead return a third key, "subagent" — a {system, prompt, label, result_preamble, tools} spec the session runs in a fresh-context model, using its reply (prefixed with result_preamble) as the tool result; see _summarize_via_subagent and _run_subagent_tool, the two producers. `allow_changes` off refuses mutating tools here — the last line of defense behind the catalog/search filtering, since a stale schema or hallucinated call can still name one — and `allow_delete` off refuses destructive tools the same way. `ledger` is the calling session's SessionLedger — its subagents pass the same one, and a caller passing none (the headless tests) shares _fallback_ledger. `repeat_owner` scopes the repeat numbering to the caller (a session or one subagent run), UNLIKE the shared ledger: repeat counts belong to one agent's turn, and a shared count would tag a fresh subagent's first call as a repeat someone else made. Unknown names return an error message rather than raising, so a hallucinated call surfaces to the model instead of breaking the loop. Every completed call flows through _apply_hooks, so EVENT_HOOKS follow-ups fire uniformly no matter which tool ran or who called it. In-editor, execute is a coroutine — mutations, subprocess checks, and scans yield frames instead of blocking the editor — so callers must await it; headless nothing ever suspends, so it resolves synchronously (the test scripts rely on this).

## Number a repeated call whose work really happened again, so its result stops rendering identically to the last one. This is the shared half of the honesty rule the loop brake depends on: the brake keeps its full force (a genuinely pointless repeat still returns identical content and is still caught), while a tool that CHANGED something says so. A refusal is left alone — it changed nothing, so an identical one is exactly the repeat the brake should catch.

## Yield one editor frame. Headless runs skip the suspension entirely — the test scripts call execute synchronously from SceneTree._init, where frames never iterate — so every await in the tool chain resolves immediately there and execute stays synchronous outside the editor.

	if Engine.is_editor_hint():
		await Engine.get_main_loop().process_frame


## Serialize whole edit_file/write_file runs: validation yields frames, and a second mutation interleaving mid-run could clobber the first one's baseline restore. Also waits out worker scans so a mutation never rewrites files a scan is reading; run_on_worker holds the counter side of that bargain. Release is a plain `_mutation_busy = false` by whoever acquired.

		await _yield_frame()


## Run `job` on a worker thread and return its result, yielding editor frames until it finishes; headless it runs inline so tests stay synchronous. Jobs must touch only thread-safe APIs (FileAccess/DirAccess/RegEx/ResourceLoader) and return plain data — never EditorInterface, the scene tree, or the tool layer's statics. Entry waits out any in-flight mutation and the scan counter keeps a mutation from starting mid-scan in return (see _acquire_mutation_lock).
static func run_on_worker(job: Callable) -> Variant:
	if not Engine.is_editor_hint():

## The check_dependents hook action: after a successful edit_file/write_file changes a .gd's top-level class_name or extends, name the files that build on it — the break is invisible locally, since this file validates clean while dependents fail with "Could not find base class". The dependent set is found textually (like list_dependencies' reverse mode) rather than by parse-checking each dependent, because the editor refreshes its global class cache asynchronously after the write, and a headless recheck racing that refresh would pass on the stale cache and miss the break.

## Whether `value` names an integer in any spelling a model produces: an int, a WHOLE float (every JSON number arrives as one — JSON has no integer type), or a numeric string whose value is whole ("6", "6.0"). "6.5" and overflow spellings like 1e19 are refused in every form — raw float and string alike — so their corrective message survives instead of silently landing on a truncated or wrapped target. The one judgment behind _arg_int and every satellite parser's index/count argument, so no tool refuses in one spelling a number it accepts in another.

## is_integer_like narrowed for arguments where a String also names something — a tile source, a track path: a string reads as an index only spelled as a plain integer ("2"), so a name like "2.0" (a texture-basename source name, a track path) keeps resolving as the name it is.
static func is_index_like(value: Variant) -> bool:
	if value is String:
		return String(value).strip_edges().is_valid_int()
	return is_integer_like(value)


## Whether `f` is a whole float an int can hold — finite, integral, and safely inside int64 range. The guard every whole-float→int widening consults, so "1e19" and inf spellings keep their refusals instead of overflowing into garbage; the conservative bound costs nothing, since no real index or count lives near int64's edge.
static func _whole_int_float(f: float) -> bool:
	return is_finite(f) and f == floorf(f) and absf(f) < 9.0e18

## A string-array argument, read from the first of `keys` present in `args`: a real array's elements stringified, or a lone string as a one-element array — a schema-blind model passes both shapes; [] when absent.
static func _arg_string_array(args: Dictionary, keys: Array) -> PackedStringArray:

		return out
	return out


## An error message when the model supplied arguments but none under a recognized key from `keys`, else "". Lets a tool report a misnamed argument instead of silently ignoring it — a filter the model believes took effect but never ran is worse than an error; `usage` states the expected shape so the retry can be correct.
static func _unexpected_arg_error(args: Dictionary, keys: Array, usage: String) -> String:

## Read the file named by `args.path` and return an execute()-shaped result: normally "<resolved path>:\n\n<contents>", but a file past GDLLMTunables.READ_FILE_SUMMARY_THRESHOLD characters defers to a `subagent` map instead (see _summarize_via_subagent) and a loadable .tscn returns its saved node tree (see _scene_read_map) — both overridden by `args.full` (whole file regardless) or a `start_line`/`end_line` range (exactly those lines verbatim, see _render_line_range). Long packed-array payloads are elided in every DEFAULT path — before the threshold is measured, so the gate judges the size that would actually be delivered (see _elide_packed_arrays) — while `full` returns them verbatim and sticky-disarms the overwrite gate (see SessionLedger.elided_files). Errors return as plain content the model can recover from; binary files are refused so a garbled blob never lands in the conversation.

## The one-line lever appended to any result whose shown text carries elision markers: name what was withheld and the argument that returns it, so a marker is never a dead end (goal 3). Empty when nothing shown was elided — a clean read costs the context nothing. Counted by the marker's exact shape, never a substring, so a user's file that merely TALKS about elision is not miscounted (see _elision_marker_regex).

Bounds are clamped to the file instead of erroring, so an off-by-a-few guess still shows the region.

## The compact view read_file returns for a loadable .tscn instead of its raw serialized text — the same saved-tree view describe_scene_file composes, behind a preamble naming the ways back to the real text. Returns "" when the file does not load as a scene or holds no nodes, so the caller falls through to the raw read: a broken .tscn is the one case where the serialized text IS the answer.
static func _scene_read_map(resolved: String) -> String:

## The result the read_file call standing in for a user attachment would have returned, formatted exactly as _read_file formats it — a whole-file read, or a numbered line range when start_line/end_line name the user's selection — and recorded in the ledger the same way a real read would, so an attached file grounds a later edit_file instead of being refused as never-shown (see _mark_seen). `text` is the editor's live buffer, not disk, which is why `unsaved` prefixes the divergence: without it the model would take a re-read as reproducing this, and silently get different content.

## The result the describe_scene call standing in for an attached scene-tree selection would have returned — produced by CALLING that tool's own composer, so the attachment and a later re-run can never render differently.
## Deliberately no _mark_seen: describe_scene's view is explicitly not valid ground for editing serialized text (edit_file says so outright), so an attached node must not unlock an edit the model has not actually read the file for.
## `ordinal`/`total` prepend WHO chose this node, which the body alone cannot say: an attachment turn is indistinguishable from the model having made the call itself, so asked "what node do I have selected" it read its own synthetic call as a guess it had made and denied being able to see the selection at all — twice in four wild sessions, while reciting the node's real properties in the same breath.
## The note carries the count because the question is often plural, and a model that can see "1 of 3" can answer it without inferring anything.
## read_file attachments deliberately get no such line (0 of 6 wild sessions misread one): their body already names the file, so the provenance is not the answer there, and a line that fires on every attachment is context paid for on every later request.
## `selected_total` above `total` means the selection outran the attach cap, which is stated rather than dropped quietly — otherwise a model asked "what nodes do I have selected" would confidently answer with a count that is simply wrong.

## Whether the editor's cached instance of `resolved` would serialize differently from the file on disk. The engine has no get_unsaved_scenes() counterpart for resources, so divergence is measured directly: the cached instance and a cache-bypassing fresh load are each serialized to a scratch file and compared byte-for-byte, which keeps the comparison in engine truth (formatting, sub-resource ids, and stored-property filtering all match a real save) instead of a hand-rolled deep diff. Callers gate on the edited flag first (which implies editor context and a cached instance); the scratch save clears that flag as a side effect (the saver does that on every save, whatever the destination), so a TRUE result restores the flag it consumed and a FALSE result leaves the stale flag healed.
static func _res_cached_diverged(resolved: String) -> bool:

## Whether the editor's cached copy of the saved resource at `resolved` carries unsaved modifications. The engine's per-object edited flag is the cheap filter — set by every property write in editor builds (Inspector edits arrive that way through UndoRedo) and cleared again by loading and by every ResourceSaver save — but it over-reports: UNDOING an Inspector edit re-flags the object (UndoRedo marks everything it touches, both directions), so a flagged copy is confirmed by _res_cached_diverged's byte-compare before being called unsaved, which also heals a stale flag along the way. Only the ROOT object's flag means anything: deserialization set()s embedded sub-resources' stored properties and never clears them, so their flags read as edited straight from a load — an Inspector edit made ONLY inside an embedded sub-resource is invisible here and escapes detection. Costs two hash lookups on the uncached majority, so the whole project can be swept at send time.

## A resource's would-be-saved form as raw bytes, via a scratch save in the editor's cache directory; empty when it cannot be serialized. `tag` keeps the two sides of a comparison in separate scratch files, and the process id keeps concurrent editor instances (this cache directory is shared machine-wide) out of each other's comparisons.

## Correct a hand-written uid in serialized scene/resource text before it lands on disk: transcripts show models inventing header uids ("uid://abc123…") or keeping the source file's uid when writing a copy, then churning over the damage. The engine's registry is the truth — a declared uid that isn't this path's registered one is rewritten (to the registered uid for a known file, else to a fresh engine-generated one, registered immediately so a second write this session can't collide with it) and the correction disclosed. One transcript-observed exception: a model that preloads the uid it plans to give the file has coordinated the two sides, so a collision-free invented uid that other project files already reference is KEPT and registered rather than replaced — replacing it broke the referencing script. An invented uid that gets replaced is recorded in the ledger's replaced_uids, so a later write referencing the invented text is substituted with what it became instead of landing broken (see _lint_new_uid_refs). Returns {} when the text needs no change, else {"text", "note", "end"} — `end` is the corrected region's end offset so a caller anchoring an excerpt after it can shift its offset; a kept uid returns the text unchanged with only the note.

## Handle the uid:// literals a write INTRODUCES — present in the new text, absent from the old.

Literals already in the old text are never touched: a pre-existing stale uid elsewhere in the file must not block an unrelated edit.

## Whitespace-tolerant fallback for an old_string that matched nothing exactly: whole lines are compared in a normalized form where only whitespace may differ (see _ws_normalized_line). Returns {} when nothing matches even this way, {"matches": n} when several places do (ambiguous — nothing is applied), or on the UNIQUE match {"updated", "at", "inserted", "note"}: the full new file content, the char offset of the match, the replacement text with its leading whitespace translated by the old→file mapping the match exhibited, and the disclosure sentence the result must carry. Applying instead of bouncing saves the model a failure round trip — the observed intent is unambiguous — while the note keeps what happened fully visible. One intent is refused instead of applied (`is_gd` only): a column-0 `func` declaration whose lead the mapping would make non-empty returns {"nested_func_decl", "line_start", "line_end"} — GDScript has no named nested functions, so that adjustment is guaranteed breakage (transcript-observed: it buried a dev-menu handler inside another function as a "lambda" parse error).

When the post check ran but the BASELINE run died, `attributed` goes false and new_load/new_prop_warns carry the post check's FULL findings rather than a diff an empty baseline would inflate; the caller words its verdict without blame then. The clean case costs one subprocess; the pre-edit baseline only runs when the post-edit check found something. Both baseline-swap writes are checked: a baseline that can't be written skips the pre run and reports unattributed (an unchecked swap once diffed the post content against itself and called fresh damage pre-existing), and a restore that fails even on retry sets `restore_failed` — the file then holds the PRE-edit content and the caller must report the edit unsaved, because "saved" would be a lie about disk state a user's Ctrl+S could then silently entrench.

## Validate a just-written .gd file against its pre-edit state, returning the _gd_check_shape keys: the parse/compile errors and style-lint problems this edit introduced, whether the post-edit checks themselves ran, and how far the verdict can be trusted. `checked` is false when the post-edit parse run failed to launch, hung, or died (`why` names it, phrased to complete "the engine validation run …") — every list is then empty and the caller must report the change as UNVALIDATED, because an empty error list from a dead subprocess once read as a clean engine-checked bill. `post_clean` says whether the post-edit parse check passed, since the diff alone can't tell a clean file from unchanged pre-existing damage. new_parse/new_lint are normally the post-minus-baseline diff (the pre-edit content is restored around the baseline runs so both checks see the file at its real path — a copy elsewhere would trip class_name/global-class resolution); when a BASELINE run dies instead, `parse_attributed`/`lint_attributed` go false and the lists carry the post check's FULL findings, because an empty baseline would inflate pre-existing damage into "you introduced 59 errors" — the accusation trap the diff exists to avoid. Only errors the engine attributes to THIS file are diffed; other files' load noise rides along in `foreign` for disclosure. `post_errors` is the post-edit check's full own-error set, the form the caller fingerprints against check_script's pre-existing ledger. `lint_checked`/`lint_why` disclose a lint run that never finished; lint stays advisory either way. The caller keeps the edit in every case. A baseline only runs for a check the post-edit pass failed — pre-existing problems can't surface in an empty diff — so a clean edit costs two engine runs, not four. Both baseline-swap writes are checked: a baseline that can't be written skips the pre runs with attribution honestly unknown, and a restore that fails even on retry sets `restore_failed` — the file then holds the PRE-edit content and the caller must report the edit unsaved, because "saved" would be a lie about disk state a user's Ctrl+S could then silently entrench. A cancel (see cancel_running_checks) bails with the unchecked shape after restoring the edited content, carrying restore_failed if that restore was the one that failed.

## The sentence a shader's error report ends with, or "" for anything else so it costs the context nothing where it isn't true.

## One engine-truth check run over `res_path` (a tools/load_check.gd child), its Parse/Compile Error lines classified by the file they belong to (see _classified_parse_errors) plus "ok"/"why" saying whether the run itself completed — the shared launcher behind check_script, its automatic hook, write_file's new-file check, and the edit-validation runs. The child checks after the project's autoloads register as script globals, so autoload references — most gameplay code — compile instead of dying as "Identifier not found" (--check-only exits before autoload setup and misread every such script as an abnormal exit); a Compile Error that still surfaces is real damage, not headless noise. Completion is judged by the child's sentinel, never inferred from exit codes; ok=false means nothing is known about the script, never that it's clean. A load that fails without the engine printing why (the child's LOAD_CHECK_FAILED marker) is folded into an own error so it can't read as clean either.

## The classified-error run for whichever compilable source `res_path` is — the .gd parse check or the .gdshader compile — so every caller that validates a source file asks one question and gets one shape back.

A file that failed to load outright is folded into an own error for the same reason it is on the script path — a load that never happened must not read as a clean bill.

## Read one shader check run's output into the classified-error shape, taking only what load_check.gd's stderr bracket attributes to `res_path` — a project can compile other shaders while this one is checked, and the engine names no file on a shader error, so the bracket is the only attribution there is.
## The compiler reports at most ONE error per run (it stops at the first), which is why the caller states as much rather than letting a count of 1 read as "one thing wrong".
## An error the engine locates inside an #include'd file keeps that file's name and line and deliberately drops the "line N:" prefix, since that number indexes the OTHER file — prefixed, the excerpt composer would quote the wrong file's line at it.
## An unsupported shader type is the file's own mistake only when the declared type isn't one the engine has: a real type refused by this check would be the checker falling short, so that case returns no verdict instead of an invented error. GDScript parse errors can never belong to a shader, so that whole channel — located or not — is other files' noise here.

## One SHADER ERROR message, with the engine's own wording kept and the cause appended where the wording points nowhere.

## Classify every Parse/Compile Error in one engine run's output by the file it belongs to, returning {"own", "own_located", "foreign"}: `own` holds `res_path`'s errors location-stripped (so a pre/post diff survives line shifts), `own_located` the same errors as "line N: message" where the engine named a line, and `foreign` display lines for errors attributed to OTHER files — a broken autoload, or a .tres whose [ext_resource] is missing, load noise a whole-output scrape used to blame on the checked script (transcript-observed at scale: one missing dependency put 48-60 such lines in every check). Compile Errors count because the check runs with autoloads registered (see _classified_script_errors), so one names real damage, not the headless autoload miss it used to be. Attribution reads the engine's two location shapes: the "res://path:N - " prefix on the error line itself (resource loaders) and the "(res://path:N)" location on the "at:" line that follows (GDScript); an error with neither stays own rather than hidden. An exact repeat of an already-seen located error is dropped: a broken script errors once when autoload setup loads it and again in the check proper, and counting both would double the report and poison the pre/post diff.

## Run the running engine binary (OS.get_executable_path()) headlessly against this project with `extra_args` appended, returning {"ok", "why", "output", "exit_code"} — combined stdout+stderr plus whether the run actually completed; the shared launcher for the parse, lint, and load checks. Kept minimal (--headless, no full editor) so the subprocess stays fast. Launched through a pipe rather than OS.execute because OS.execute waits unconditionally — a wedged check would freeze the editor with it — while this drains output in a bounded poll and kills the subprocess at `timeout_ms` (GDLLMTunables.ENGINE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS for the validation checks; run_script passes its own, model-raisable cap). ok is false when the subprocess failed to launch, hit the timeout, or (given `done_pattern`, a regex a finished run's output always matches) died before completing: empty output from a dead run once parsed as ZERO errors and earned a false "engine-checked" clean claim, so a caller must treat ok=false as "nothing is known" — never as clean — and surface `why` (phrased to complete "the subprocess …") in its own result rather than in a push_warning nobody sees.

## Tell the editor a file changed on disk so the change is picked up: update_file reindexes it and scan_sources refreshes the global class list in case a class_name moved; a script open in the script editor is reloaded on the spot so Godot's "files newer on disk" prompt never fires for a change the user already sanctioned by enabling edits. Guarded by is_editor_hint so a headless (non-editor) run — including the unit tests — skips it instead of touching an absent EditorInterface.

## Write a whole text file at `args.path` — new or replacing an existing one wholesale — creating missing directories; the creation counterpart to _edit_file, sharing its writer, .gd validation, and editor refresh. The file is KEPT even when its content fails the parse or load check: the errors come back with orders to fix them at once, and the write marks the path seen in the session's ledger since the model authored every byte. The destination is sanitized then taken literally (a new file can't be resolved), except that a bare name matching an existing file resolves to it so a replacement needn't spell the full path; a user:// destination is honored as spelled — the user:// data directory sits inside the fence — while the uid, phantom-collision, validation and editor-refresh machinery applies only to res:// destinations, and a write landing elsewhere says it went unvalidated.

## The uid:// text identifying a project file, tried from the loader's cache first and then from where the uid physically lives — a .uid sidecar (scripts), the file's own header tag (.tscn/.tres), or its .import (imported assets) — so UID matching works even where the cache is cold. The in-file probe accepts ONLY the [gd_scene]/[gd_resource] header's uid: in a headerless file the first uid= belongs to an [ext_resource] dependency, and reporting that as the file's own sent a session preloading its new boon through the AugIncrement script's uid (transcript-observed) — no answer beats a wrong one.

## One chat session's tool-layer memory, passed through execute() so nothing leaks across sessions: one tab's reads must not unlock edit_file for another, and one tab's broken files must not nag another.

The transport guards (_mutation_busy and friends) stay static — they serialize genuinely shared resources (disk, validation subprocesses) across every session.

	## The on-disk text the last successful edit_file/write_file replaced, by resolved path — ONE generation of real history, kept solely to make one error truthful: a model that rewrote a file and then edits from its memory of the old text is told the actual cause (a stale copy) instead of whitespace advice (see _edit_file_not_found_message). Never written back to disk.

	var legended_importers: Dictionary = {}
	## Invented uids the write-time lint replaced with engine-assigned ones this session, invented text → real text — so a later reference to the invented uid (a model coordinating a script and a resource it authored, in either order, including across its subagents) is substituted with the real one instead of landing broken, and error attributions can name what the invented uid became (see _lint_new_uid_refs and _uid_error_attribution).
